## All Palindromic Partitions

* Given a string s, find all possible ways to partition it such that every substring in the partition is a palindrome.

Examples:

1. Input: s = "geeks"
   Output: [[g, e, e, k, s], [g, ee, k, s]]
   Explanation: [g, e, e, k, s] and [g, ee, k, s] are the only partitions of "geeks" where each substring is a palindrome.

2. Input: s = "abcba"
   Output: [[a, b, c, b, a], [a, bcb, a], [abcba]]
   Explanation: [a, b, c, b, a], [a, bcb, a] and [abcba] are the only partitions of "abcba" where each substring is a palindrome.

#### Constraints:
 -> 1 ≤ s.size() ≤ 20

 #### Companies:
 -> Amazon
 -> Microsoft
 -> Facebook
