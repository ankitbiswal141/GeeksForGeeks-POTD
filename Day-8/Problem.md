* Given an array arr[ ] consisting of digits, your task is to form two numbers using all the digits such that their sum is minimized. Return the minimum possible sum as a string with no leading zeroes.

### Examples :

1. Input: arr[] = [6, 8, 4, 5, 2, 3]
   Output: "604"
   Explanation: The minimum sum is formed by numbers 358 and 246.

2. Input: arr[] = [5, 3, 0, 7, 4]
   Output: "82"
   Explanation: The minimum sum is formed by numbers 35 and 047.

3. Input: arr[] = [9, 4]
   Output: "13"
   Explanation: The minimum sum is formed by numbers 9 and 4.
